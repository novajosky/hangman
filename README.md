# Hangman
 This project is Hangman. In this Hangman game, the user has to try to guess the secret word that is randomly selected by the computer. The user will have 10 incorrect guesses before the game is lost.

## Technologies used
This game was created using HTML CSS and Javascript without the use of libraries or API's.

## Getting Started
https://novajosky.github.io/hangman/ <br>
In this game, the user clicks on the letters they think may be in the secret word. When each letter is clicked, the computer will detemine if the letter is in the secret word and add it or the computer will add a body part to the hangman and the wrong guess counter will increase letting the user know how many tries they have left. Icluded is a hint button for the user to fall back on to help figure out the secret word.

## Next Steps
When revisiting this game, I intend to create a categories button for the player to choose from. Also, I want to add an option for multiplayer. In this case, a second user can type in a word for the player to try to figure out.
