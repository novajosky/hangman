The game will generate a word using a randomWord function using math.floor(math.random()).
Let guessed will keep track of the users guesses and wrong guesses will be added to maxGuesses while correct guesses will be added to the board.
The function handleGuess will determine wether the guess is correct or incorrect using if else statements and add each result by 1
Upon wrong guesses the hangman picture will change to the next slide including a body part of the avatar.
checkifgamewon and checkifgamelost will iterate after every choice and will ultimately tell the user if they win or lose.
Hint is added to the board to allow the user to get a clue upon onclick.
Reset is available to allow the user to restart the game with a new secret word onclick.
